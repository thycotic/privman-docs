## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 11.1.0 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* In support of __custom data collections__, the [Computer by Name Pattern Query](../admin/resources/cust-data-src.md) was added to Privilege Manager. The query allows to create custom collections containing a subset of computers based on a wild card supported name query.
