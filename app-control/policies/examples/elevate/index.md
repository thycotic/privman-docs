# Elevation Policies

Distinct from Whitelisting policies where applications are simply allowed to run with default user level privileges, an Elevation Policy will apply Administrator credentials to specified applications. This type of policy is often paired with Whitelisting to save IT Administrators time when many employees must perform trusted tasks that require Administrator credentials to complete, like installing a trusted application (Adobe) or device (printer).
