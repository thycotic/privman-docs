# 10.8.0 Release Notes

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 10.8 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* Enhanced upgrade process for on-premises instances. Privilege Manager now checks if updates are available and downloads details prior to proceeding. Refer to [Updating Privilege Manager - Primary Node](../install/upgrades/index.md#primary_node).
* The Application User Activity report provides audit details for user activities like logins and logouts. Refer to [Application User Activity](../reports/app-user-activity.md).
* The __Specific Installer Detection Filter__ and __Generic Installer Detection Filter__ are now labeled as legacy filters. These filters are only to be used to detect legacy installers that require the Windows Application Compatibility flag to be set.

### macOS Specific Features

* Added macOS Agent Utility preference pane accessible via system preferences. Refer to [MacOS Agent Utility Preference Pane](../agents/macOS/utility.md).
* Extended the __Agent Summary by OS__ report to also contain macOS system serial number information.

## Bugs Fixed

* Agent registration fails due to foreign key constraint error pointing to missing target.
* The Resource Explorer does not honor an OU name update for Active Directory Foreign Systems.
* An URL specified with "http" only does not apply strict transport security for communication.
* Users in Privilege Manager Cloud are unable to configure tasks to send email reports.
* Domain user groups cannot be added to the User Context Filter.
* Secondary file filter pre-filtering performance is lacking.
* Errors when clicking on bar graphs for Local Security statistics about Users.
* Customer accounts with an ampersand (&) in the company name or license cannot activate their license.
* An error is thrown when attempting to add a managed user to a resource target.
* The Report Summary of Application Action report only contains the first 3 to 5 records when exported to CSV.
* When exporting a report with many records, the __Select All__ option for CSV exports does not export all records.
* Upgrade banners are not displayed for the latest version.

### macOS Specific

* System calculated due time for scheduled task as negative, causing an exception.
* macOS agents with a comma or equal sign in their name are not successfully registering.

## Known Issues

* Upgrading to Privilege Manager 10.8 causes a task to run to merge computer groups and remove unused system computer groups. This primarily affects the Application Control policies that are using resource targets/computer groups named __All Windows Computers with Application Control Agent Installed__.  With 10.8, those policies will use the __Windows Computers__ computer group and macOS will use __MacOS Computers__.
