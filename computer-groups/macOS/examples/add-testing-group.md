# Adding macOS Agents to a Computer Testing Group

<!-- hiding this topic from the TOC and publishing until I know the exact steps for MacOS - it's a TODO:

The Policy Configuration examples in the following section will use a Learning Mode Policy that enables us to perform actions (i.e. run applications) on a test computer that Privilege Manager will then pick up. This makes targeting specific applications during policy creation easy.

## Setting Up Monitoring Policies for macOS

To create a Monitoring (or Learning Mode Policy) on your Mac, begin by 

1. adding your newly registered macOS Agent to your Test Computer Group for Macs.

1. In Privilege Manager go to __Admin | Event Discovery | Configuration__, then click the underlined Application Compatibility Testing Computers link next to the Log all MacOS activity option.
1. Under the __Filter Definition__ tab, select the macOS computer(s) you want to target for testing under the Include Specific Resources section. This "Testing Computers" group should only be used for testing specific machines and configuration purposes. It should not be assigned to large groups of computers in your production environment.

>**Note**:
>You may have both macOS and Windows target computers listed in this group, but policies are platform-specific, meaning they will distinguish between macOS and Windows computers.

1. To activate your learning mode policy for this target group, verify that the __Log all MacOS activity from Application Compatibility Testing Computers__ is checked under the General tab of __Admin | Event Discovery | Configuration__. 

   Under __Admin | Policies | Mac OS__ tab, you should also see an Event Discovery Testing Computers (MacOS) policy enabled.
