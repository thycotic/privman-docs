* Added computer SID registration information to be availed via resource manager computer global account data.
* Renamed __Suppress UAC__ Action to __Suppress UAC (Legacy)__. Refer to [Default Actions](../admin/actions/default-actions.md#set_environment_variable_action) and [Adjust Process Rights Action](../admin/actions/unrestricted-token.md).

* New Linux/Unix OS support in the form of an Agent connecting to the Privilege Manager Server to exchange policies and events.

### Cloud

* 

## Security

* Added Strict-Transport-Security header to 301/400/403 http responses.
* Improved path traversal and invalid header handling.
* Client-side password complexity check improvements.
* API endpoint authentication improvements.

## Bug Fixes

* When adding a Persona, not all configuration options are visible in UI.
* The Application Control Service is creating a conflict when saving or printing Excel or Word files.
* Local user logout does not work correctly, preventing another local user from logging in.
* Errors in exported Agent Log file are not displayed.
* User accounts in a child domain do not appear as members of a local group.
* Folder View loads slowly for large resources with over 200K endpoints.
* The Administrator group is showing up twice when viewing the Group Policies section.
* User and group inventory may not reflect proper group membership the first time it runs on the endpoints. Subsequent runs will finish processing that information and will be accurate.
* Users removed from Security Group in AD still show as members of the AD group inside Privilege Manager.

### Cloud

* 

### macOS

* 

## Known Issues

* The Advanced Commandline Filter might throw a required field error showing what looks like an item ID, but is not. Please provide input for all required fields.
* Upgrading to Privilege Manager 10.8 or later from version prior to Privilege Manager 10.8.0 causes a task to run to merge computer groups and remove unused system computer groups. This primarily affects the Application Control policies that are using resource targets/computer groups named __All Windows Computers with Application Control Agent Installed__.  With 10.8, those policies will use the __Windows Computers__ computer group and macOS will use __MacOS Computers__.

  If you want to prevent this automatic merge, modify the XML of this item:

  `PrivilegeManager/#/item/xml/b2e02684-d154-48ca-9987-12b1759df822`

  Add on line 2 `<adc:Attributes>NoModify</adc:Attributes>`.
* Offline upgrades on __multiple__ servers will need to be done manually.
* With the Safari Browser, the behavior for default selection on drop-down menus might vary from other browsers.

### macOS Specific

* On endpoints using OneDrive, GoogleDrive, DropBox, or similar extensions, the endpoint will take about 2 min to correctly initialize the [Finder Extension](../computer-groups/macOS/examples/self-elevation.md#troubleshooting__verify_the_finder_extension_is_installed) functionality after enabling the extension or after the upgrade to 10.8 with an enabled extension.
* If you have a policy allowing management of the /Applications folder via the Copy Install Application filter, deleting multiple applications from the /Applications folder will result in a dialog prompting for administrator credentials. The workaround is to have your end-users delete applications one at a time.
* If you have enabled the Elevate Privilege Manager Agent Preference Pane (Sample) policy to elevate the Agent preference pane and you wish to target Big Sur, you will need to duplicate it and change the File Names to:

  `legacyLoader;legacyLoader-x86_64`
* If you have already duplicated the Elevate Privilege Manager Agent Preference Pane (Sample) policy to elevate the Agent preference pane and you wish to target Big Sur, you will need to change the File Names to:

  `legacyLoader;legacyLoader-x86_64`
