* Basic Inventory, which triggers the agent to immediately report basic inventory back to the server. The information can be viewed for a computer under Known Data. Data sets are different based on endpoint operating system.
* Resource Discovery Client Task, which populates agent-side data for any resources that have been discovered but lack detailed information.
* Update Applicable Policies, which triggers policy updates at the endpoints.
