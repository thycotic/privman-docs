# Privilege Manager on Windows

Once Privilege Manager is added to a companies infrastructure, it discovers all accounts that exist on endpoints and allows Privilege Manager Administrators to control the exact membership of every local group via its Local Security features. This ensures the correct admin and root accounts are permanently set. Additionally, credentials will be controlled by enforcing password rotation on those accounts.

Privilege Manager's Application Control allows administrators to manage application activity on endpoint machines. Applications that require admin rights or root access can be automatically elevated, allowed applications are allow listed, and malicious applications are blocked.

Specific to the Windows Operating systems are the management of:

* [Client System Settings](client-system-settings.md)
* [Adjust Process Rights Action](../../admin/actions/windows/unrestricted-token.md)
