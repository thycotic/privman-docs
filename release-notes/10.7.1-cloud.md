## Bug Fixes

* When creating Filters for Windows systems and the user has the Privilege Manager MacOS Administrators role, an exception is shown.
* Misleading counts when built-in local Admin users are backed-up by provisioned user.
* When creating a copy of an __Approval Request (with ServiceNow Request Item Number) Form__ action, the contents cannot be edited.
* Security ratings reports pagination is not working correctly.
