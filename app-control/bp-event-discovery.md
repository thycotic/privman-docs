# Best Practices

In Privilege Manager the option to Send Policy Feedback is the main notification mechanism about application installation and execution on user endpoints. Using Send Policy Feedback is recommended while systems are in Event Discovery and Learning Mode. This helps administrators to gather data, analyze patterns, and then assign actions to application events retrospectively. 

It is not recommended to use Event Discovery for all configurable options and all user endpoints all the time. Event Discovery in an established production environment should be targeted to not generate unnecessary and overwhelming amounts of data.

## What’s First

Privilege Manager includes policies to discover when an end user runs an application that requires administrative rights. Creating policies for any known applications and tasks should be first. Organizations are aware of applications that require elevated permissions to run or install. Collect any files that have already been identified and create policies targeting those applications.

Often different users have different rights on their endpoints, based by division, hierarchy, or other classifications. Privilege Manager can quickly inventory local groups and users. If current permissions are unknown, use Privilege Manager to discover which accounts have administrative permissions on each endpoint. Action can be taken to immediately remove suspicious or unwanted users and groups.

Understanding which users and groups have administrative rights, allows you to properly assess what permissions should exist on an endpoint.

>**Note**:
>Do not elect to Send Policy Feedback for trusted applications for those specified groups that are cleared to use and install the applications.

### Event Discovery

Event Discovery is Privilege Manager’s process to determine which applications will require policies.

Based on your use cases, different Event Discovery policies should be enabled. Enable event discovery for the most common use cases like:

* applications that require elevated rights,
* installers, and
* processes that trigger a UAC prompt.

Privilege Manager admins will work through the results of Event Discovery and build policies targeting these applications. Admins will determine if a file should be added to an allow, deny, or elevation policy. If elevated, determine if the file will be silently elevated or if justification, approval, or another workflow will be required.

Add the applications that are discovered to policies with priorities to be triggered before Event Discovery. This will prevent those applications from continuing to be discovered by Event Discovery in the future.

Following this process will naturally clean up the results from Event Discovery.

### Never Disable Event Discovery

Event Discovery is not a short process. It’s an integral part of Privilege Manager. Once Event Discovery is enabled, it is never disabled.

Even after all policies have been built and all end user needs are met and the local admin groups are empty on all endpoints, you’ll still want to know if there are new items that require elevated permissions. Or, after admin rights have been removed, you may want to setup Event Discovery to send feedback if someone runs an application in a context that is unexpected and highly suspicious.

What is discovered and who/which machines Event Discovery targets may change, but Event Discovery will always be used in some capacity.

Event Discovery will never be disabled – you will always want to discover new events that require elevated rights. Consider a maturity plan for Event Discovery.

* Begin by silently discovering applications and creating filters/policies. 
* As policies are tightened, add a justification prompt for new items. 
* When admin rights have been removed and policies are set, use an approval process or reputation check for newly discovered items.

Event Discovery cannot be sped up. Files will only be discovered when end users initiate a process. If a certain team has an application that is only used at the end of the quarter to finalize business, that application will only be discovered once it is run by the end user.

The scale can be adjusted to ensure the workload is manageable. Start small, understand the workload when the pipeline is slow, then scale to the workload that can be maintained. 

## Purpose of Event Notifications

Event notifications are helpful and important when administrators want to initially establish policies and to continually monitor the installation and execution of new/unknown applications.

For a production environment it is necessary to know when potentially dangerous applications are installed on a user endpoint. It is not important to be notified every time a white listed application is installed or run on a system.

>**Note**:
>That means that silent elevation policies do not need an event notification and should not have Send Policy Feedback enabled. Information should only be given on application events that require a follow-up with actions.

Approval and justification policies always generate an event as required for an audit trail. These events cannot be subdued.

Self-elevation, blacklist, and other events on an endpoint triggering UAC are part of the never-ending event discovery process in an organization.

## Best Practices

Create policies that are used for a certain amount of time before they are revisited and potentially adjusted for current needs. Target specific systems or user groups with group specific policies. Once those requirements are set, define what events will need a follow-up action in your environment:

* What exceptions can be made if any
* When to use overrides
* What to block
* What to blacklist.

For certain groups of users, it might also be an idea to target a specific machine routinely to use the data to fine-tune any policies that are enforced on the endpoint. Group policies based on existing groupings – AD OUs, AD user groups, SCCM groups, etc.

However, requirements and circumstances are not set in stone and revisiting existing and established policies is part of a best practice approach in PAM.

It is important for administrators to know when (and potentially why) blacklisting policies are triggered. It indicates that employees are violating company policy. However, if this happens a lot, it might indicate that there is a business need for this application and that the blocked software was not fully understood. 

## Examples

### Send Policy Feedback

An UAC override policy allows a user to elevate a program not blocked by a blacklist or elevated by a whitelist, by reentering their password to install/run, is a good candidate for sending policy feedback. It presents an exception to normal execution of programs as an unprivileged user. This type of event logging should be used to identify new programs to add to silent elevation policies if the frequency warrants, or to audit user usage to elevate items they shouldn't to mark them for blocking or follow up action.

### Don’t Send Policy Feedback

For most business organization it makes no sense to implement a policy that sends feedback when a MS Office product or the company wide instant messaging product is installed or run. For user groups like developers, programming tools are needed and running those should not trigger any notifications.
