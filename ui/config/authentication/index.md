# Authentication Tab

The Authentication tab is used for setting up the Authentication Provider used with Privilege Manager. Different authentication providers can be setup based on configured Foreign Systems. Each configured authentication provided will be available as a login choice to users on the login page.

>**Note**:
>If you are trying to change your Authentication Provider specifically to NTLM, Privilege Manager runs a verification to make sure the local build-in Administrators Group is in the Privilege Manager Administrator Role.
