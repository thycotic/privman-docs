This filter is available for both Windows and macOS systems. Use this filter for macOS endpoints only to target known scripts or command-line tools; otherwise use the [Default File Specification (macOS)](../macOS/file-specification.md) filter.

>**Important**:
>On macOS 10.15 (Catalina) use the new preference pane specific filters to target macOS preference panes.
<!-- The File Specification Filter definition does not work on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) when the File Names field starts with "com.apple.preference" and/or Path field starts with "/System/Library/PreferencePanes/". Any Policies leveraging these filter definitions are also impacted. -->
