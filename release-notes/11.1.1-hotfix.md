# 11.1.1 Hotfix Release Notes

_July 3rd, 2021:_

Privilege Manager v11.1.1 is a hotfix release to resolve issues discovered in v11.0.0 and v11.1.0 instance and agent deployments.

## Bug Fixes

* Parameter Name for Import Azure Users/Groups task is incorrect.
* Indexes missing or duplicated for resource key items.
* Computer Group Based on Azure AD Security Group Not Showing Correct Machines.
* The Group Member Authentication Action is unable to resolve Azure AD groups to allow authentication.
* The Import Specific Azure AD Users and Groups task does not resolve correctly against the specified user or group name.
* The Justify Action message in policies errors out and does not allow a user to run an application as intended by the policy.

### Agents

* Improvements for agent database file locations.

### Security

* Removal of account name information from GET method for CreateItemByRoleType.

## Known Issues

* When a Justification Message action is triggered by an application control policy for an application process that is started via commandline, the agent creates an error. The workaround is, to exclude admins from the justification request and to use a policy with an Advanced Message Action.
