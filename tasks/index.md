The following topics are available:

* [List of default tasks](default-tasks.md)
* [Maintenance tasks details](maintenance.md)
* [Other tasks to schedule](scheduled/index.md)
  * [Emailing Reports](scheduled/email-reports.md)
* [Running the SDDL by Client ID Task to only allow specific users to start/stop agent services](sddl-client.md)
