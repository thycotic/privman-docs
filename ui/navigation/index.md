# Navigation and Controls

In Privilege Manager navigation and controls are aligned with Thycotic's standard user experience.  The main navigation menu is situated along the left side of your browser window and controls on each page are standardized.

The button for a __page refresh__ and the __More__ drop-down options are available at the top-right of your page.

Whenever you are in editing mode on a page, you find a __Save__ or __Cancel__ banner on the top of your page.
