# File Collection Security Catalog Filter

This is a special collection of files to whitelist or blacklist. This filter type is similar to other Inventory Filters, particularly our Security Catalog Filter.Â *No out-of-box filters exist in Privilege Manager for this type*.

You can use these filters to target executables found in security catalogs. The built-in filter targets the Signed Security Catalog (\Windows\System32\catroot\) and is typically used to automatically whitelist applications from Microsoft.
