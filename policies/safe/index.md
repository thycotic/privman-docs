# Whitelisting Policies

Whitelisting is a type of policy that allows applications to run on your endpoints. You can think of Whitelisting as a neutral policy type because it does not alter an application’s default permissions, it merely signifies that the application is “known/trusted” and allowed to run. Although simple whitelisting follows normal, user-level credentials, whitelisted applications are also often paired with Elevation Policies outlined [Elevation Policies](elevation-policies.md).

The following examples are available:

* [Whitelist MS Security Catalog](wl-ms-sec-cat.md)
* [Whitelist Google Application with File Upload](wl-g-app-file-up.md)
