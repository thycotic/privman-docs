# macOS Agents

The Bundled Mac Agent DMG + PKG installer is available for macOS systems. You can use this installer directly on individual endpoints for testing or for production environments.

## Installing macOS Agents

>**Note**:
>If you enter the wrong install code or you need to update an install code for whatever reason, rerun the package installer to provide the correct/new install code.
>The Install Code field can be left blank when using versions lower than 10.5.

### Directly

The Bundled macOS Agent is a DMG + PKG file. You can use this Mac agent installer directly on individual endpoints for testing or production environments.

To install the agent software on a single testing machine, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Agent Downloads](https://tmsnuget.thycotic.com/software/Agents/ThycoticManagementAgent-10.7.23.dmg) and download the Privilege Manager Mac Agent.
1. Run the Bundled Mac Agent DMG + PKG Installer on the computer you want to manage.
1. During the setup process,
   1. enter the base URL and
   1. the Install Code when prompted.â€‹

>**Note**: The bundled installer does require a restart in order to ensure the agent is ready to use.

### Using an Unattended Install Method

Begin by downloading the DMG + PKG package (See link for Privilege Manager Mac Agent listed above) on one of your Mac endpoints. Run the installer by double clicking the PKG file.  

After installing this first agent, navigate to _/Library/Application Support/Thycotic/Agent/agentconfig.json_. The agentconfig.json file stores information such as your organization's URL and a few other custom settings like 'Task Polling Interval,' etc.

Open the file and add the "installCode" parameter after the "tmsBaseUrl" to that file as shown in the following code sample:

```json
{
                "tmsBaseUrl": "https://servername/Tms/",
                "installCode": "VALUEHERE"
}
```

There are two methods for deploying your remaining Mac agents in an unattended fashion:

* Network File Share
* Distribution Tool  

#### Network File Share

If you want administrators to deploy agents onto individual macOS endpoints, save the PKG installer from the DMG side-by-side with the __agentconfig.json__ file in a network share folder.

Due to new macOS security enhancements, users cannot run a PKG installer from a network share anymore. The administrator must then run the installer command-line tool from __Terminal.app__ after mounting and cd'ing to the directory containing the PKG installer and __agentconfig.json__ file:

```cmd
cd /Volumes/<network share>/<path to PKG installer>
sudo installer -pkg ThycoticManagementAgent-10.7.23.pkg -target /
```

The PKG will first look for an __agentconfig.json__ file located in the same folder. When it finds this file, it will copy __agentconfig.json__ into the _/Library/Application Support/Thycotic/Agent_ folder during the unattended install on the Mac endpoint where the installer is running.

#### Distribution Tool

Using a Deployment Tool like Jamf or SCCM, include both the PKG installer and the __agentconfig.json__ files in the distribution package together, then deploy the package onto your endpoint Macs by running a script using a tool or remotely by using ssh to install the PKG, for example:

```shell
sudo installer -pkg ThycoticManagementAgent.10.7.23.pkg -target /
```  

As in the example using a Network Share, the PKG will first look for an __agentconfig.json__ file located in the same folder. When it finds this file, it will copy __agentconfig.json__ into the _/Library/Application Support/Thycotic/Agent_ folder during the unattended install on the endpoint Mac where the installer is running.

For more instructions on how to deploy in bulk using Microsoft Software System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), Microsoft instructions for Macs are described [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj687950.aspx).

## After Initial Deployment

If the Mac already has an existing __agentconfig.json__ file, it will NOT be overwritten because creating a file only occurs if the computer didn't already have an __agentconfig.json__ installed. This means you can use the same distribution package for upgrades and new installs.

>**Note**:
>It will take 15-30 minutes for newly installed agents to register in Privilege Manager. See the agent registration information in the [Terminal Commands](agent-inst-mac.md#terminal_commands) topic to speed the process up.

## Uninstalling an Agent

When you need to uninstall the macOS Agent, use the __Uninstall.sh__ shell command:

```shell
sudo /Volumes/ThycoticManagementAgent-10.7.23/Uninstall.sh
```
