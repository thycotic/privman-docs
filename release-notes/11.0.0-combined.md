## Bug Fixes

* The Application Control Service is creating a conflict when saving or printing Excel or Word files.
* Local user logout does not work correctly, preventing other local user from logging in.
* Errors in exported Agent Log file are not displayed.
* User accounts in a child domain do not appear as members of a local group.

## Known Issues

* Upgrading to Privilege Manager 10.8 or later from version prior to Privilege Manager 10.8.0 causes a task to run to merge computer groups and remove unused system computer groups. This primarily affects the Application Control policies that are using resource targets/computer groups named __All Windows Computers with Application Control Agent Installed__.  With 10.8, those policies will use the __Windows Computers__ computer group and macOS will use __MacOS Computers__.

  If you want to prevent this automatic merge, modify the XML of this item:

  `PrivilegeManager/#/item/xml/b2e02684-d154-48ca-9987-12b1759df822`

  Add on line 2 `<adc:Attributes>NoModify</adc:Attributes>`.
* Offline upgrades on __multiple__ servers will need to be done manually.
* With an approval policy targeting a PowerShell script (.ps1 file) via secondary file filter, the Approval Notice pop-up causes a critical error alert when accessing the .ps1 file via right-click Edit menu option.
