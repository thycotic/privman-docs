# 11.1.1 Hotfix Release Notes

_July 3rd, 2021:_

Privilege Manager v11.1.1 is a hotfix release to resolve issues discovered in v11.0.0 and v11.1.0 instance and agent deployments.

## Bug Fixes

* Parameter Name for Import Azure Users/Groups task is incorrect.
* Indexes missing or duplicated for resource key items.
* Computer Group Based on Azure AD Security Group Not Showing Correct Machines.
* The Group Member Authentication Action is unable to resolve Azure AD groups to allow authentication.
* The Import Specific Azure AD Users and Groups task does not resolve correctly against the specified user or group name.
* The Justify Action message in policies errors out and does not allow a user to run an application as intended by the policy.
* Authentication provider changes do not trigger an application pool recycle.

### Agents

* When the agent registration key path on older agent installations is set to the wrong directory, an _UpdateClientItemLastRequested: Database file is locked_ error message is triggered. The key `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Arellia\ApplicationControlAgent` should show the ProcessCache database as `C:\ProgramData\Arellia\*` and not `C:\ProgramData\Application Data\Arellia\*`.

### Security

* Removal of account name information from GET method for CreateItemByRoleType.
