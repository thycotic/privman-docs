# Filter Types and Descriptions

There areÂ different types of filters. When creating a new filter for Windows or macOS, the "Filter Type" dropdown gives you a list of options that include the categories:

* [Application Filters](application/index.md)
* [File Filters](file/index.md)
* [Inventory Filters - Windows only option](inventory/index.md)
* [macOS Specific Filters](macOS/index.md)

These are loose groupings that signify a few different approaches to the filtering method or targets.

## Common Filter Characteristics

Each filter has a Details area that contains the filter name, description, and platform association. These details are usually specified when you create the filter, either by choosing the New Filter button, editing an existing filter, or making a copy of an existing filter.

Those characteristics are used for searches or filtering and allow users to easily find existing filters.
