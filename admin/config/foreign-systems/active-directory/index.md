# Active Directory Integration

By adding an Active Directory Domain the system can synchronize users, groups, and computers. Once configured a directory synchronization task will need to be started to actually import AD information. Default User Credentials need to be created as well for the system to be able to connect.

The following topics are available in the Active Directory (AD) integration section:

* [Setting Up Local Active Directory Synchronization](ad-sync.md)
* [Setting Up Azure Active Directory Integration in Privilege Manager - v10.6 and up](set-up-privilege-manager-azure-ad-integration.md)
