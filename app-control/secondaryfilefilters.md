# Creating Policies for Applications Triggering File Execution

Implementing a policy to filter on a file type that is used by another executable is done by setting a **Secondary File Filter**.

This article shows the steps used to create filters and policies that enforce actions on  endpoints when batch files, PowerShell scripts, or Microsoft Installer files execute. Any type of executer can be specified and policed this way.

In general, the steps are similar for the different file types to be policed.

* You first create an application or file filter that identifies the executing application, for example \*.ps1,
* then you create the secondary file filter identifying the file type by adding the file or application filter (\*.ps1) under Settings,
* then you create a policy, specifying Application Targets, and
* use an Inclusion and/or Exclusion filter specified as and using the Secondary File Filter.

The following three examples show how to setup file filters to deny running single files, such as a .bat, .ps1, and .msi.

## Batch File Example

### Creating the File Filter for .bat Files

In this example we are creating a filter for the target executing .bat files.

1. In the Privilege Manager Console navigate to **Admin | More | Filters**.
2. On the Filter page, click **Add New Filter**.
3. On the New Filter page, select the platform. This can be either **Both Windows / Mac OS**, **Windows**, or **Mac OS**. For this example, select **Windows**.
4. From the Filter Type drop*down select **File Specification Filter**. This also allows you to link in hashes or signatures.

5. Enter the name and a description for the filter, for example “test.bat” and “filter for batch files”.
6. Click **Create**.
7. The page for the new filter opens, click **Edit**.
8. Under File Specifications in the File Name field enter either a single file name, file specification, or RegEx.

   ![Filter Name](images/sff/file_specifications.png)

   For this example, we use **test.bat** to police a single file name.

## Best Practices

As a best practice you create an elevate policy with a priority of X (for example 20) to elevate or allow specific scripts or files to run. Then you add a policy with a priority of X+1 (for this example 21) to deny any other execution of the command processor, PowerShell, or Microsoft installer files. For this example .msi is used.

### Creating the Allow notepad++\*.msi Filter

## Updating the Endpoints with the Policies

After adding new filters and policies, the endpoints need to be updated to
enforce the new rules.

This can be done directly:

1. On the Policy Details page select the **Deployment** tab.
2. Click **Run Policy Targeting Update**.

From any other location in the Privilege Manager console follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Admin | Config**.
2. Select the **General** tab.
3. Click **Policy Targeting Update**.

## RegEx Examples

When using RegEx instead of a single file name or tile specification, make sure to verify the syntax and test your filter before using it in production.

Program name with version in file name:

```RegEx
(flashutil[ a*zA*Z0*9\\.]+exe)
```

Winamp58_3660_beta_full_en*us

```RegEx
(winamp[ a*zA*Z0*9\\.]+exe)
```

Wireshark*win64*2.6.6.exe

```RegEx
(wireshark*win64*[ a*zA*Z0*9\\.]+exe)
```
