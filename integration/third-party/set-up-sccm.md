# Set-up Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) Integration

Privilege Manger integrates with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to allow the

* [import of computers](#import-computers) for use in computer groups and identifying systems that exist on the network, but donâ€™t have an endpoint agent installed yet.
* [import of existing Device Collections](#create-a-collection) from SCCM and use them for Privilege Manager computer groups.
* [inventory of SCCM Software Packages](#inventory-software-packages) to use the package contents in Privilege Manager Application Control policies.

## Create a Credential

Privilege Manager needs a username and password to access SCCM.  If you have not already created an appropriate user credential:

1. Navigate to __Admin | Configuration | User Credentials__.

1. Click __Add New__, to create user credentials to access SCCM.

1. After entering the user credentials information for SCCM, click __Save Changes__.

## Connecting to SCCM

Before you can import data from SCCM you need to setup a foreign systems connection in Privilege Manager for the SCCM integration.

1. Navigate to __Admin | Configuration__ and select the __Foreign Systems__ tab.
1. Select __System Center Configuration Manager__. If this is not listed, make sure the connector is installed by verifying via the Privilege Manager Add/Upgrade Features page.
1. Click __Add New__.

## Inventory Software Packages

Once the Foreign System has been created, an on-demand packages synchronization can be run and/or a regular synchronization schedule can be set-up via the following steps:

1. Navigate to __Admin | More__ and select __Tasks__.
1. On the Tasks tab open the folder tree and select __Server Tasks | Foreign Systems | SCCM__.
1. Click __SCCM Sync Packages__.  

   ![Synchronize Packages Task](images/sccm/sccm-task-run-packages.png)
1. Click __Run__.
1. Select your SCCM system via the __Select resource...__ option.

   ![Run customized task](images/sccm/sccm-task-run-packages-select.png)
1. Click __Run Task__.

Alternatively the __SCCM Sync Packages__ task can be scheduled to regularly repeat. When viewing the task, navigate to the Schedules tab and create a new schedule.

### Create a SCCM Package Content Filter

After the Package Synchronization completes the SCCM Packages can be used in application control policies via package content filters.

1. Navigate to __Admin | Filters__.
1. Click the __Add Filter__ button.
1. From the Platform drop-down select Windows.
1. From the Filter Type drop-down scroll to Inventory Filters and select the __Package Contents Filter__.
1. Set the Name and Description of the filter.
1. Click __Create__.
1. Click __Edit__.
1. Next to Package, click __Select resource...__.
1. Select the package from SCCM that will be targeted.
1. Set the Results will be to __Included__.

    ![New Package Content Filter](images/sccm/package-contents-filter.png)
1. Navigate to the __Membership__ tab.
1. If no items are listed in the membership table, click the __Sync Package__ button.

    ![Update Membership](images/sccm/package-contents-filter-sync.png)

    Running the sync package task, causes the server to inventory the package referenced in the filter. If you have multiple filters and packages, Thycotic recommends to use the _Inventory Packages Referenced in Whitelists_ task instead.
1. Click __Save__.

This filter can then be referenced in Application Control policies.
