# Allow Listing Policies

Allow listing is a type of policy that allows applications to run on your endpoints. You can think of allow listing as a neutral policy type because it does not alter an application’s default permissions, it merely signifies that the application is “known/trusted” and allowed to run. Although simple allow listing follows normal, user-level credentials, allow listed applications are also often paired with Elevation Policies outlined [Elevation Policies](elevation-policies.md).

The following examples are available:

* [Allowlist MS Security Catalog](ms-sec-cat.md)
* [Allowlist Google Application with File Upload](google-app-file-up.md)
