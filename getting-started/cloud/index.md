# Getting Started Overview - Cloud

The following topics provide a guided path through the instance setup and subsequent initial sign-in steps of a cloud Privilege Manager instance.

* [Cloud Quickstart Guide](cloud-quickstart.md)
* [Cloud Login](cloud-init.md)
* [Agents Installation](../../install/agents/index.md)

  * [Setting the Server Address for Privilege Manager Agents](../../install/agents/agent-set-server-address.md), if the address provided during the agent installation requires updates.

## Rollout Recommendation

Familiarize yourself with the [Least Privilege](../../pm-intro/least-privilege.md) concept. Thycotic recommends a phased roll-out between the Application Control and Local Security, for example:

1. [Application Control](../../app-control/policies/bp-event-discovery.md): Set up learning mode policies on a group of test endpoints to learn about applications running on your endpoint machines ([Event Discovery | Learning Mode Policies â€“ Send Policy Feedback](../../app-control/policies/ac-event-discovery.md))
1. Local Security: Begin [managing your local user accounts](../../local-security/index.md) (only) and defining local group membership (Local Security | Manage Local Users)
1. Application Control: Tailor your policies so that they won't disrupt employee work ([Creating Policies | Elevation Policies](../../app-control/policies/examples/elevate/index.md)) but will block known malicious applications (Creating Policies | Example: Quarantine Specified Malware). Implement these basic policies across agents in production
1. Application Control: Continue to tailor policies according to employee roles. Create a "Request Access" system for any unknown applications. ([Creating Policies | Example: Application Execution Requires Approval](../../app-control/policies/examples/elevate/app-req-app.md) (Workflow))
1. Local Security: Once a workflow has been established between employees and the Privilege Manager Helpdesk, begin managing all local privileged accounts (ex: local admins) on endpoints. (Local Security | Details Tab)
