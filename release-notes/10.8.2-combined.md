* Added complex password enforcement.
* Added logout enforcement.

### macOS

* New [Just-in-Time (JIT) Group Membership action](../admin/actions/jit-group-member.md) for elevation/approval policies.

#### Pertaining to Big Sur and Catalina

* Endpoint Security system extension replacing most functionality previously provided by the KEXT.
* The __AdjustEffectiveProcessRightsContract__ action has been deprecated for endpoint running macOS Big Sur.
* Added SUDO Plugin for elevating from command line. Refer to [Sudo Plugin](). Policies that previously just elevated a process no longer work and the elevation has to be run via sudo instead.

* Added resource target for macOS Big Sur endpoints, __All macOS Big Sur Computers with Application Control Agent Installed (Target)__, which is used in the default Policy __Retry errored TMS Events - Catalina and Big Sur (macOS)__, previously named __Retry errored TMS Events - Catalina (macOS)__ only.
