1. From the Platform drop-down select __Mac OS__.
1. From the Policy Type drop-down select __Show All Templates__.

1. Click __Add Action__ and select Application Approval Request Message Action then click __Add__.
1. Navigate to Policy Enforcement and select any of the options:

On the macOS endpoint,

1. Login as Admin user.
