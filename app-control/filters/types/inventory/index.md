# Inventory Filters

These depend on file inventory data, meaning they generally apply to already discovered applications or files pulled in by Privilege Manager tasks. For example, after running an inventory task on a specific computer or group of computers, Privilege Manager can glean through the list of file inventory that is reported and target those files.Â 

>**Note**:
>No out-of-box filters exist in Privilege Manager for this type of filter category. Most Filters of this type are associated with a data source during their creation. That data source is not to be changed. The exception is the Security Catalog File Filter where the data source needs to be added after the filter has been created.
