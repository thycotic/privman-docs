# Getting Started Overview - On-premises

The following topics provide a guided path through the on-premises installation and setup steps that are part of the initial stand-up of an on-premises Privilege Manager deployment. For cloud specific getting started instructions refer to [Getting Started Overview - Cloud](cloud/index.md).

### Preliminary Configuration

Refer to these topics to learn more about the initial installation and setup steps:

1. [System Requirements](../install/sysreq.md)
1. [Antivirus Exclusions](../install/antivirus-exclusions.md)
1. [Privilege Manager Installation](../install/installation/index.md)
1. [Agents Installation](../install/agents/index.md)

   * [Setting the Server Address for Privilege Manager Agents](../agents/all/agent-set-server-address.md), if the address provided during the agent installation requires updates.
1. [Login](login.md)
1. [Licenses](licenses.md)

>**Note**: If you are targeting macOS based endpoints refer to [Getting Started with macOS](../platforms/macOS/bp/cfg-profiles/index.md).
## Rollout Recommendation

Familiarize yourself with the [Least Privilege](../pm-intro/least-privilege.md) concept. Thycotic recommends a phased roll-out between the Application Control and Local Security, for example:

1. [Application Control](../policy-events/bp-event-discovery.md): Set up learning mode policies on a group of test endpoints to learn about applications running on your endpoint machines ([Event Discovery | Learning Mode Policies â€“ Send Policy Feedback](../computer-groups/app-control/ac-event-discovery.md))
1. Local Security: Begin [managing your local user accounts](../computer-groups/local-security/index.md) (only) and defining local group membership (Local Security | Manage Local Users)
1. Application Control: Tailor your policies so that they won't disrupt employee work ([Creating Policies | Elevation Policies](../computer-groups/app-control/examples/elevate/index.md)) but will block known malicious applications (Creating Policies | Example: Quarantine Specified Malware). Implement these basic policies across agents in production
1. Application Control: Continue to tailor policies according to employee roles. Create a "Request Access" system for any unknown applications. ([Creating Policies | Example: Application Execution Requires Approval](../computer-groups/app-control/examples/elevate/app-req-app.md) (Workflow))
1. Local Security: Once a workflow has been established between employees and the Privilege Manager Helpdesk, begin managing all local privileged accounts (ex: local admins) on endpoints. (Local Security | Details Tab)
