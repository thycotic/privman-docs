# 11.1.0 Release Notes

_TBD, 2021:_

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 11.1.0 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* In support of __Computer Name Pattern Collections__, the [Computer by Name Pattern Query](../admin/resources/cust-data-src.md) was added to Privilege Manager. The query allows to create custom collections containing a subset of computers based on a wild card supported name query.

### macOS Specific

* Added support for file inventory of app bundles as zip files via File Upload.

## Bugs Fixed

* Justification and approval messages are not working when used with networked drive letters in the path properties.
* Computer Groups are not always picking up all added endpoints.

### macOS

* Users added to multiple groups via macOS Just-in-Time Group Membership Action are not removed from those groups automatically.
