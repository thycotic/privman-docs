# Authentication Tab

The Authentication tab is used for setting up the Authentication Provider used with Privilege Manager. There can only be one provider at a time.

>**Note**:
>If you are trying to change your Authentication Provider specifically to NTLM, Privilege Manager runs a verification to make sure the local build-in Administrators Group is in the Privilege Manager Administrator Role.
