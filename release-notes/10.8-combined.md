* New User Interface and User Experience. Refer to [Privilege Manager 10.8 User Interface](../pm-intro/10.8-ui.md).
  * New [Policy Wizard](../computer-groups/app-control/policies/policy-wizard.md) driven Application Policy creation.

* [Standard Privilege Manager](../admin/users/index.md) users can be created to log into Privilege Manager in case a connected authentication provider is unavailable
* Additional metadata is included in Privilege Manager’s approval workflow: SHA1 hash and commandline arguments
* Additional metadata is sent to ServiceNow for approval workflows: SHA1 hash, commandline arguments, company name, version
* User context filter supports local user and local group names match by text
* Integration with Thycotic’s now SaaS based behavior analysis product, [Privilege Behavior Analytics (PBA)](../admin/config/foreign-systems/thycotic/set-up-pba.md), provides visibility into all processes interactively executed by end users.

### macOS Specific Features

* An error is thrown when attempting to add a managed user to a resource target.

* When exporting a report with many records, the __Select All__ option for CSV exports does not export all records.
* Upgrade banners are not displayed for the latest version.
* When creating or cloning an action, the user is unable to reference built-in or well-known local groups.
* CSV Report export adds apostrophe before - and + symbols

### macOS Specific

### Agent Updates

## Known Issues

* Upgrading to Privilege Manager 10.8 causes a task to run to merge computer groups and remove unused system computer groups. This primarily affects the Application Control policies that are using resource targets/computer groups named __All Windows Computers with Application Control Agent Installed__.  With 10.8, those policies will use the __Windows Computers__ computer group and macOS will use __MacOS Computers__.

  If you want to prevent this automatic merge, modify the XML of this item:

  `PrivilegeManager/#/item/xml/b2e02684-d154-48ca-9987-12b1759df822`

  Add on line 2 `<adc:Attributes>NoModify</adc:Attributes>`.
* When upgrading from 10.5 (and potentially other prior Privilege Manager versions), you may encounter an `Item Not Found` exception when first navigating to the console. The workaround for this is to recycle your app pools and then reload the console in your browser.
* When upgrading from 10.4 to the latest Privilege Manager version, the Admin menu might not load. The workaround for this is to recycle your app pools and then reload the console in your browser.
* When setting the __Monitor Resource__ switch to active on a computer resource, an error is thrown.

  ![monitor resource](images/10.8.0-ki-mon-resc.png "Set Monitor Resource to active")
* Offline upgrades on __multiple__ servers will need to be done manually.

### macOS Specific

* On endpoints using OneDrive, GoogleDrive, DropBox, or similar extensions, the endpoint will take about 2 min to correctly initialize the [Finder Extension](../computer-groups/macOS/examples/self-elevation.md#troubleshooting__verify_the_finder_extension_is_installed) functionality after enabling the extension or after the upgrade to 10.8 with an enabled extension.
