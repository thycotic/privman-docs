* __Hash algorithm__ drop-down, only one can be specified per filter:
  * MD5
  * SHA1 (only for backwards compatibility - should not be used anymore!)
  * Authenticode
  * SHA256
  * Authenticode 2

* __Hash encoding__ dorp-down:
  * Hex
  * Base64

* __Hashes (comma separated)__ text field.

## Example of SHA256 Filter

Once the filter is created, the following settings can be viewed and/or edited:
