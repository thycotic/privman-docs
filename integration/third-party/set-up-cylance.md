# Set-up Cylance Integration

Cylance is an Artificial Intelligence Based Advanced Threat Prevention Solution for enterprise environments. Privilege Manager (v10.5+) integrates with Cylance to help you proactively act on any unknown applications that run in your environment to prevent potential malware attacks. The steps below walk through how to setup a Cylance Integration in Privilege Manager and then create an example policy to begin using Cylance intelligence in action across your environment.

Keep in mind that while the Cylance integration provides insight into threat analysis, ultimately you can use Privilege Manager policies to act or react in whatever way makes most sense to your organization.
