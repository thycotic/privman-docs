# 10.8.2 Release Notes

_December 2nd, 2020:_

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 10.8.2 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* Added [CorrelationID support to Server Logs](../admin/log-viewer/index.md).
* Added [Complex Password Policy enforcement for Privilege Manager users](../admin/users/pw-complexity.md).
* Added Delete method support to [API Authentication](https://docs.thycotic.com/privman-api/10.8.0/authentication#delete) endpoint.

### Security

* Added Process Hollowing prevention for elevated applications.

### macOS

* In support of Apple's Catalina and Big Sur macOS System Extension based security enhancements a [Privilege Manager agent for SYSEX based endpoints](../install/agents/agent-inst-mac.md) is made available.
* New [Just-in-Time (JIT) Group Membership action](../admin/actions/jit-group-member.md) for elevation/approval policies.
* Added "Move to Trash bin" support.
* Modified [policy with Allow Package Installation action workflow](../computer-groups/macOS/examples/index.md#agent_behavior_with_actions) behavior for .pkg installs on macOS endpoints.

#### Pertaining to Big Sur and Catalina

* Endpoint Security system extension replacing most functionality previously provided by the KEXT.
* The __AdjustEffectiveProcessRightsContract__ action has been deprecated for endpoint running macOS Big Sur.
* Added SUDO Plugin for elevating from command line. Refer to [Sudo Plugin](../platforms/macOS/sudo-plugin.md). Policies that previously just elevated a process no longer work and the elevation has to be run via sudo instead.
* Added __All macOS Big Sur Computers__ Filter, with membership defined as any macOS Big Sur endpoint having an agent installed and registered.
* Added resource target for macOS Big Sur endpoints, __All macOS Big Sur Computers with Application Control Agent Installed (Target)__, which is used in the default Policy __Retry errored TMS Events - Catalina and Big Sur (macOS)__, previously named __Retry errored TMS Events - Catalina (macOS)__ only.

## Bug Fixes

* Logging out does not invalidate the session/cookies that may have been previously stored/cached during a valid logon session.
* Changing the API Client User secret after token issuance, does not return an authorization error.

## Known Issues

* With the Safari Browser, the behavior for default selection on drop-down menus might vary from other browsers.

### macOS Specific

* On endpoints using OneDrive, GoogleDrive, DropBox, or similar extensions, the endpoint will take about 2 min to correctly initialize the [Finder Extension](../computer-groups/macOS/examples/self-elevation.md#troubleshooting__verify_the_finder_extension_is_installed) functionality after enabling the extension or after the upgrade to 10.8 with an enabled extension.
