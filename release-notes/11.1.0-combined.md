# 11.1.0 Release Notes

_June 15th, 2021:_

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 11.1.0 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* In support of __Computer Name Pattern Collections__, the [Computer by Name Pattern Query](../admin/resources/cust-data-src.md) was added to Privilege Manager. The query allows to create custom collections containing a subset of computers based on a wild card supported name query.
* Added a framework that allows real-time status reporting of running server-side tasks. This is currently available for the AD Import task only.
* Privilege Manager now automatically sets the home directory path during provisioning.
* The Security Descriptor Agent Discoverer has been removed for new installations and will be disabled during system upgrades from pre 11.1.0 versions.
* Added Privilege Manager product version details and 3rd party web licenses information to the [About](../ui/navigation/about.md) page.

### macOS Specific

* Added support for file inventory of app bundles as zip files via File Upload.
* Added a new boolean property to the JITGroupMembershipContract to better determine the sudo plugin usage.

## Bugs Fixed

* Justification and approval messages are not working when used with networked drive letters in the path properties.
* Computer Groups are not always picking up all added endpoints.
* Password changes for standard users are not honored.
* UAC triggers false positive detection messages.
* Running Privilege Manager: Task Purge Maintenance does not work for Correlated Change History.
* ArelliaDisplayXAMLaction.exe inherits elevation from parent policy when the _Add Administrative Rights_ and/or _Unrestricted_ actions are included in a blocking policy.
* The Event Summary widget does not reflect changes when changing the associated resource target filter.
* Once the number of events crosses ~21 Million, trimming does not work.
* An issue with the Ams.SimpleWorkerTask table causes tasks not to run while agent events are processed.
* The agent summary by OS report is not reflecting the correct numbers.
* Path exclusion changes are not saved.

### Cloud

* 504 timeout error reported on loading of "Group Policies - Administrator Built-In Managed Group".

### macOS

* Users added to multiple groups via macOS Just-in-Time Group Membership Action are only removed from the first but not all groups automatically.
* Packages installed via `/usr/sbin/installer` fail to complete.

## Known Issues

* The Setup Add/Upgrades Feature page fails to provide new package information, if the Privilege Manager server is installed on a Windows 2016 system that is also configured as a domain controller.
* The File Hash Filter for Authenticode does not work. This is no longer supported with the new hash algorithms.

### macOS

* On a Safari browser the option to print licenses via the About page does not render.

## Documentation Clarifications

* [Allow Listing Policies without Actions](../computer-groups/app-control/examples/safe/index.md#allow_listing_policies_without_actions)
