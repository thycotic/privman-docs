# Approval Policies

Approval policies require an end-user justification and use an admin approval workflow.

This policy type requires that people provide a justification for why they need to run an application before elevating with administrator privileges. User Justification refers to the policy action. Since Conditions and Actions are independent, this action can be applied to any condition.

The following examples are available:

* [Offline Approvals](offline_approval.md)
* [HelpDesk Approvals](helpdesk.md)
* [Google Authenticator approval](google-authenticator.md)
