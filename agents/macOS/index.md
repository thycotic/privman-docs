## Finding Logs for Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting your Mac agent, logs are found in the Console application. There are two places to check for logs in Console:

1. You can filter your machine's logs by clicking your machine's name under Devices and typing "Thycotic" into the top search bar.
1. Thycotic-specific logs are recorded in a Console folder that is titled thycotic (found in the left side bar: __Reports | /var/log | thycotic__).
