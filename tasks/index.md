# Tasks

In Privilege Manager tasks are activities that can be run on demand or regularly scheduled. If they are regularly scheduled, the schedule triggers the execution of a task instance, which performs specific actions based on set parameters.

Tasks are set-up via Admin | More and then selecting the Tasks link. They are categorized by the following folders:

* Client Tasks
* HelpDesk Tasks
* Infrastructure Scheduled Activities
* Server Tasks

## Client Tasks

Client Tasks are used to run or schedule activities at the endpoints, like:

* Basic Inventory, which triggers the agent to immediately report basic inventory back to the server. The information can be viewed for a computer under Known Data. Data sets are different based on endpoint operating system.
* Resource Discovery Client Task, which populates agent-side data for any resources that have been discovered but lack detailed information.
* Update Applicable Policies, which triggers policy updates at the endpoints.

## HelpDesk Tasks

By default this folder is empty. Administrators can use it to copy tasks for HelpDesk users to run them. The HelpDesk folder provides security settings on those folders that would grant permissions if someone puts tasks in that area. <!-- ? follow up -->
