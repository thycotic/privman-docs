# Move to Trash Bin Policy

When a standard user deletes an application bundle via __âŒ˜-delete__ or __drag-n-drop__ from /Applications, the following actions are taken based on policy evaluation:

* Allow - Is allowed without prompting user for credentials
* Present appropriate Advanced Message Dialog: 
  * Approval - Approval process is invoked before it is allowed to complete
    * Cancelled - It is denied.
  * Denied - Denied dialog is invoked and user can not delete the application bundle
  * Justification - Justification process is invoked before it is allowed to complete
    * Cancelled - It is denied.
  * Offline-Approval - Offline-approval process is invoked before it is allowed to complete
    * Cancelled - It is denied.
  * Warning - Warning dialog is invoked before it is allowed to complete
    * Cancelled - It is denied.

To allow a standard user to delete application bundles from the /Applications directory, create an elevation policy that uses the __Copy Install Application__ filter under Inclusions. We recommend to also add a justification message action.

>**Note**: A policy configured in this way will also allow a user to update or replace an App Bundle by drag-n-drop via Finder to the /Applications folder.
