# 11.1.0 Release Notes

_June 15th, 2021:_

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 11.1.0 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* SAML Support
  * Only one SAML connection/foreign system configuration is supported.
  * Tested with Okta, Centrify, and others.
* Improved Azure AD support for:
  * User Context Filters: Azure AD users have 2 SID values. These are mapped and handled on the backend.
  * Group Policies:
    * Add/remove Azure AD users from group policies
    * Add Azure AD user SID to local machine group
* Reorganization of the Server tasks as it relates to Foreign Systems and Directory Services tasks. Created new component entry [Directory Services Maintenance Tasks](../admin/tasks/server/fs-ds-maint.md).
* In support of __Computer Name Pattern Collections__, the [Computer by Name Pattern Query](../admin/resources/cust-data-src.md) was added to Privilege Manager. The query allows to create custom collections containing a subset of computers based on a wild card supported name query.
* Added a framework that allows real-time status reporting of running server-side tasks. This is currently available for the AD Import task only.
* Privilege Manager now automatically sets the home directory path during provisioning.
* The Security Descriptor Agent Discoverer has been removed for new installations and will be disabled during system upgrades from pre 11.1.0 versions.
* [Standardized Privilege Manager logout process](../getting-started/logout-scenarios.md) to remove access token on logout.
* Renamed Group Policies to [Group Management](../computer-groups/local-security/g-mgmt/index.md).
* Renamed User Policies to [User Management](../computer-groups/local-security/u-mgmt/index.md).
* Console Audit Logs can be sent to a syslog connector, for example to Splunk.
* New [View Password role](../admin/roles/index.md#privilege_manager_view_password_role) added to Role Management.
* Commandline arguments added to policy feedback and approvals.
* Updated "About" page:
  * Added Privilege Manager product version details and 3rd party web licenses information to the [About](../ui/navigation/about.md) page.

### macOS Specific

* Added support for file inventory of app bundles as zip files via File Upload.
* Added a new boolean property to the JITGroupMembershipContract to better determine the sudo plugin usage.
* Added [Run as User action](../admin/actions/macOS/run-as-user.md) that is leveraged by the sudo plugin to run arbitrary commands as a specified user.
* Added support for [macOS Homebrew installer](../computer-groups/macOS/examples/homebrew.md).

### Unix/Linux Specific

* User and group inventory.
* Setting to delay password for "X" time after first login
* Added File hash filter support.

### Security

* Implemented friendly error message when registration fails due to invalid BaseURL, excluding stack trace details.
* Added support for additional Hash algorithms (Limitation: newer security hash algorithms are only supported on 11.1 Agents and later.)
* FIPS 140 compliance

### API

* New API to run an existing report and return the results
* Added web hooks
  * Internal hooks that can be used by 3rd party integrations
  * V1 in support specifically for a new ServiceNow app

### Integrations/Foreign Systems

* New ServiceNow integration via available ServiceNow app in application store, which is different from the already existing ServiceNow integration. Supported are:
  * Approval/denial
  * Time based approvals
  * Privilege Manager approval process support
  * Records approvals from outside normal flow

## Bugs Fixed

* Agent registration not automatically merging with Azure AD Devices data.
* Loading groups from Not Well-Known Local Group Summary or Well-Known Group Summary pages creates an error.
* Retrieving large numbers of Users and Groups can be slow.
* The application control agent creates an error when uploading a file to OneNote 2008 notebook.
* When a new managed user is created, the original created password is reset, preventing user login.
* Justification and approval messages are not working when used with networked drive letters in the path properties.
* Computer Groups are not always picking up all added endpoints.
* Password changes for standard users are not honored.
* UAC triggers false positive detection messages.
* Running Privilege Manager: Task Purge Maintenance does not work for Correlated Change History.
* ArelliaDisplayXAMLaction.exe inherits elevation from parent policy when the _Add Administrative Rights_ and/or _Unrestricted_ actions are included in a blocking policy.
* The Event Summary widget does not reflect changes when changing the associated resource target filter.
* Once the number of events crosses ~21 Million, trimming does not work.
* An issue with the Ams.SimpleWorkerTask table causes tasks not to run while agent events are processed.
* The agent summary by OS report is not reflecting the correct numbers.
* Path exclusion changes are not saved.

### Cloud

* 504 timeout error reported on loading of "Group Policies - Administrator Built-In Managed Group".

### macOS

* The sudo plugin fails to elevate binary with path relative to current directory.
* Users added to multiple groups via macOS Just-in-Time Group Membership Action are only removed from the first but not all groups automatically.
* On agent installation, a Privilege Manager Server URL with a port number is not saved properly.

## Known Issues

* The Setup Add/Upgrades Feature page fails to provide new package information, if the Privilege Manager server is installed on a Windows 2016 system that is also configured as a domain controller.
* The File Hash Filter for Authenticode does not work. This is no longer supported with the new hash algorithms.

### macOS

* On a Safari browser the option to print licenses via the About page does not render.
