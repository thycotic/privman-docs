# 10.8.1 Release Notes

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 10.8.1 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* Improved the way we treat cookies as they pertain to IIS header limits (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/iis/http-bad-request-response-kerberos) in user group memberships to avoid potential error conditions.

## Bug Fixes

* The Application Justification Report by default shows all justification events for all computers instead of just events for the selected computer.
* Agent versions 10.4 and 10.5 cause error condition "Failed to resolve user SID" during approval workflow.
* RegEx syntax rules are broken when targeting secondary file filter information.
Enhancements, Bug Fixes, and Known Issues are for both, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.
* When upgrading from 10.5 (and potentially other prior Privilege Manager versions), you may encounter an `Item Not Found` exception when first navigating to the console.
* Endpoints on Virtual Machines do not show local users associated with resources.
* In IE11 the dates in the agent log calendar view are rendered in the same color as the background and only readable when selected.
* When setting the __Monitor Resource__ switch to active on a computer resource, an error is thrown.
