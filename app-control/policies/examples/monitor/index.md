# Greylisting Policies

Greylisting Policies apply to any unknown applications that will attempt to run in your environment. It is important to discover unknown applications and determine whether to let them run or whether they are harmful. Greylisting provides a system for discovering the unknowns and adding an action that hinges on a reputation check.

The following examples are available:

* [Catch-All Policy](catch-all.md)
* [Reputation Checking](reputation.md)
