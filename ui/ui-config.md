# Configuration

There are many configuration settings to allow Privilege Manager to be customized to each specific environment. These range from how often the Agents communicate with the server to which foreign systems are setup. This configuration section contains the most commonly adjusted settings, but does not contain all configurable settings.

When clicking the __?__ to the top right, the Configuration page gives the user an overview of the Key Configuration settings and System Health.

The configuration page is tabulated and offers configuration options under the following tabs:

* [General](ui-config-general.md)
* [Discovery](ui-config-discovery.md)
* [Reputation](ui-config-reputation.md)
* [Users](ui-config-users.md)
* [Credentials](ui-config-credentials.md)
* [Foreign Systems](ui-config-foreign-sys.md)
* [Roles](ui-config-roles.md)
* [Advanced](ui-config-adv.md)
* [Authentication](ui-config-auth.md)
* [Change History](ui-config-history.md)
