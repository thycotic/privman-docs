For more information on this, see our Advanced ServiceNow Integration Guide here.

1. The task you just ran creates several new items in your ServiceNow dashboard. Open ServiceNow and navigate to Scripted Web Services | Scripted SOAP Services to verify that these three new options are listed:
   1) CancelExecuteAppApprovalRequest,
   2) CreateExecuteAppApprovalRequest,
   3) GetExecuteAppApprovalRequestStatus

   Now you've successfully defined a SOAP endpoint that Privilege Manager knows how to call to initiate a ServiceNow request for approval.

   Next, navigate to the Thycotic Management Server Silverlight Console (installed in step 3):

1. Open an Internet Explorer Browser (not Edge) Go to https://DomainName/TMS/Setup and click on Security Manager Console. If this is your first time opening Silverlight, you may need to follow the download prompt to install.

In Thycotic's Silverlight Console you will first create a new ServiceNow Approval Process.

1. Click the Tasks tab, scroll to find Workflow in the left window and expand the window. Navigate to Automation | Approvals, right click on Approval Processes, then New | Approval Process | ServiceNow Approval Process

   ​User-added image

1. Your ServiceNow Approval Process will now appear under Approval Processes. Click on this.​
1. Next click the search icon and select the name of your ServiceNow Server that you created in step 6.

1. Next to Create request service, type CreateExecuteAppApprovalRequest
   Next to Get request status service, type GetExecuteAppApprovalRequestStatus
   Next to Cancel request service, type CancelExecuteAppApprovalRequest

   > **Note**: The names of these services must be the same in Privilege Manager and ServiceNow or the integration will break. Click Save.

1. Now, still under Workflow in your Silverlight Tasks tab,
   1. Navigate to Automation | Approvals, right click on Approval Types and then New | Execute Application Approval Request
   1. Click Service Now Execute Application Process under Approval Types
   1. Select the ServiceNow Approval Process as your Process Handler. Click Save.

Lastly, you will need to create an action and attach it to a policy to manage what events you want sent to ServiceNow for approvals. To do this, navigate back to Privilege Manager (https://DomainName/TMS/PrivilegeManager):

1. Next, navigate to Policies | Create New or find an existing policy that you want to use for ServiceNow Approvals.
   If you need help creating a new policy, see the Privilege Manager User Guide here.
1. On the Policy's detail view under the Actions tab, click Edit and Add Action. Search for the action you just created (ServiceNow Approval Request Form Action). Click Add, then Save.

1. Update your endpoints by sending this new policy to target agents. Policies automatically update according to a schedule. For steps on how to do this immediately, see page 12 of the Privilege Manager User Guide here.

## Integration Workflow

Now that you have a policy attached to your ServiceNow integrated Action, the requests from your policy will be sent through ServiceNow for approval.

1. On your endpoint, perform the action that your policy targets for ServiceNow Approval. You will be prompted with a justification window to explain your request. To approve these requests, open your ServiceNow Dashboard.

​   User-added image

1. Go to MyApprovals in ServiceNow and you will see your new requests. Click Requested for details.
1. In the Request page you will be able to view details of what action is being requested, and you can Accept the action.
