# Scheduled Tasks

In addition to maintenance tasks, there are other tasks that should be scheduled to run regularly by Privilege Manager administrators. Itâ€™s recommended to run these tasks to determine how long they take to complete in each environment, then schedule appropriately to cover task completion and needs.

## AD Import and Synchronization Tasks

Import Active Directory users and groups on demand and based on a set schedule.

__Notes__: Depending on AD structure and size, the tasks should be planned to avoid bulk imports and synchronization of too large of a number of accounts.
