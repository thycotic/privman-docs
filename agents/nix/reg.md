## Registering the Agent

The pmagent service isnâ€™t required to be running for Privilege Manager policies to be executed, although for scheduled jobs to run successfully, the pmagent service need to be registered, for example:

`pmagent --register -u https://192.168.248.201:443 -c WC5W-W2DD-ONLE`

Where:

* -u xxxxxx is the PMServer address and port
* -c xxxxxx is the agent code

You can append command with a -V for extended output.

Once registered the following is inserted into the `/etc/sudo.conf`:

```bash
Plugin sudoers_policy /opt/thycotic/lib64/pmsudo_plugin.so
Path noexec /opt/thycotic/lib64/pmsudo_noexec.so
```

Once registered the following is inserted into the `/etc/shells`:

```bash
/usr/bin/pmsh
```

The Agent will also create a `xxxxxx.thyorig` and `xxxxxx.thybak` files of the original files modified.

* `thyorig` is a copy of the original file before we make any changes.
* `thybak` is a copy of the file taken before any additional changes made. This is being updated during agent upgrades.
