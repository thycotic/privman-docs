# 10.7.1 Release Notes

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 10.7.1 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions On-premises and Cloud unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* General in product user guidance improvement for Mobile Application configuration.
* New Configuration Feed to ignore macOS Catalina Software Updates. For details refer to [Ignoring macOS Updates](../config-feeds/ignore-os-updates.md).
* Improved verbose logging during token validation logic.
* The policy __Agent Service Start / Stop Control (Windows)__ is now obsolete. Users should disable that policy and/or delete it. We have added a new policy named __Restrict Account Permissions on Agent Services (Windows)__. Users should clone that policy, to edit and assign to the desired targets, and enable.
* Computers in Domain Groups can be leveraged as resource targets to be used in policies.
* It is no longer necessary to include the __.app__ extension for the Bundle Name property of an App Bundle Filter (e.g. Console.app). The agent will account for its presence while performing policy evaluation and properly match the filter if it is applicable.

### 10.7.1 Cloud specific

* For Privilege Manager, data centers in Canada and Singapore have been added.
* ServiceNow connector is automatically installed for all new cloud instances.
* The SMTP server is automatically configured during the cloud instance setup.

## Bug Fixes

Listed below are the bugs that have been addressed in this release. The description below reflects the product behavior prior to the fix. Bug Fixes are addressed for both versions On-premises and Cloud unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* When creating Filters for Windows systems and the user has the Privilege Manager MacOS Administrators role, an exception is shown.
* Misleading counts when built-in local Admin users are backed-up by provisioned user.
* When creating a copy of an __Approval Request (with ServiceNow Request Item Number) Form__ action, the contents cannot be edited.
* Security ratings reports pagination is not working correctly.
* macOS latency in updating a VNODE structure on disk is resulting in application execution being denied.
* Cannot add new policies with application targets and enable.
* Selected credentials on AD foreign system cannot be edited.
* Changing authentication providers throws an exception.
* A Privilege Manager client license count is exceeded message is displayed when it exceeds the 90% threshold and valid licenses are still available.
* Any domain groups added as a local administrator in the LSS Computer Groups disappear after being added.
* Built-in roles are repeated in the configuration page and errors are thrown when adding a new user.
* Creating a user context filter with a properly formatted SID that does not exist fails. A malformed SID results in an unfriendly error message.
* Users cannot add new machines to a managed computer group.
* For policies using a Group Member Authenticated Message Action, members in nested groups are not validated during the authentication process.
* Users in nested groups don't get the proper application role.
* Cross site anti-forgery token validation was using an email as a match, but the value was configured as a name.
* The Resource Target Computer List removes previously selected items when attempting to add additional computers.
* Privilege Manager installs prior to 10.5 cannot be upgraded to 10.7.0.
* Preferences cannot be fetched or saved by non-administrative users.
* Agent hardening removes permissions to modify/delete Agent Services.
* ServiceNow connector fails when upgrading Privilege Manager from 10.4 to 10.7.0.
* The __Domain Users as Local Administrators__ and __Summary of Domain Users as Local Administrators__ reports are timing out when run in large environments.
* Changes to the default file inventory from the Event Discovery page are not saved.
* UNC share policies imported from Config Feeds are not displayed under policies.
* Application control agents installed on Windows 10 machines are not reported on the __Application Control Agent Summary__ report.

## Known Issues

* The macOS self-elevation feature is not supported for systems running macOS 10.11 (El Capitan). The Privilege Manager Finder Extension does not work when installed on macOS 10.11. Thycotic recommends upgrading macOS endpoints to a newer version of the macOS operating system to utilize the latest feature enhancements in the Privilege Manager 10.7 and newer macOS endpoint agent.
