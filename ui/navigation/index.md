# Navigation and Controls

In Privilege Manager navigation and controls are aligned with Thycotic's standard user experience.  The main navigation menu is situated along the left side of your browser window and controls on each page are standardized.

The button for a __page refresh__ and the __More__ drop-down options are available at the top-right of your page.

Whenever you are in editing mode on a page, you find a __Save__ or __Cancel__ banner on the top of your page.

![cancel](images/save-cancel.png "Cancel/Save banner in editing mode")

Breadcrumb navigation is provided on the top left of your page.

Table column sorting and filtering is available via the ellipsis on each table column:

Controls to enable or disable a setting are unified across the user interface via on/off type switches. Users preferences like number of grid rows and color theme can be specified, these will be applied through the console one edited and saved.
