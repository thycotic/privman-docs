# Inventory Filters

These depend on file inventory data, meaning they generally apply to already discovered applications or files pulled in by Privilege Manager tasks. For example, after running an inventory task on a specific computer or group of computers, Privilege Manager can glean through the list of file inventory that is reported and target those files.Â *No out-of-box filters exist in Privilege Manager for this type of filter category*.
