# Blacklisting Policies

Blacklisting is a policy that denies applications from running on your endpoints based on application attributes, file hash, location, or certificates. This is a powerful type of policy and it may be used to block specific, known and unwanted applications from running. A blacklist policy can target programs that prevent productivity for your end users or applications that are known malware. If malware, you can also add a quarantine action for your blacklist policy as outlined in the second example below.

The following examples are available:

* [iTunes with File Upload](bl-iTunes-file-up.md)
* [Quarantine Specific Malware](bl-quarantine.md)
