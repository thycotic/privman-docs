# 10.7.1 Release Notes

## Enhancements

Enhancements available with the 10.7.1 release of Privilege Manager. Enhancements are for both versions, On-premises and Cloud, unless otherwise outlined under a specific On-prem or Cloud subtopic.

* Security group and organizational unit resource targeting options were added to the local security group management feature. Refer to [Create New Computer Group](../local-security/ls-computer-groups.md#create_new_computer_group).
* Computers in Domain Groups can be leveraged as resource targets to be used in policies.
* General in product user guidance improvement for Mobile Application configuration. Refer to [Privilege Manager Mobile Application](../mobile/index.md).
* New Configuration Feed to ignore macOS Catalina Software Updates. For details refer to [Ignoring macOS Updates](../config-feeds/ignore-os-updates.md).
* The policy __Agent Service Start / Stop Control (Windows)__ is now obsolete. Users should disable that policy and/or delete it. We have added a new policy named __Restrict Account Permissions on Agent Services (Windows)__. Users should clone that policy, to edit and assign to the desired targets, and enable. Refer to [Agent Hardening](../install/agents/agent-hardening.md)
* Improved verbose logging during token validation logic.

### macOS specific features

* Best Practices for macOS system preference panes have been added, refer to [Best Practices System Preferences](../ui/macOS/bp-sys-pref.md).
* Improved and new macOS event discovery filters, refer to [List of Default Filters for Event Discovery](../app-control/filters/types/macOS). Beginning with macOS Catalina, Apple changed the location of the application bundles that ship with the operating system. Traditionally, these applications were located in /Applications. Now they are located in /System/Applications. That location however is masked by Finder. The new and improved filters worked with both locations.
* It is no longer necessary to include the __.app__ extension for the Bundle Name property of an App Bundle Filter (e.g. Console.app). The agent will account for its presence while performing policy evaluation and properly match the filter if it is applicable. Refer to [App Bundle Filter](../app-control/filters/types/macOS/app-bundle.md)

### 10.7.1 Cloud specific

* For Privilege Manager, data centers in Canada and Singapore have been added.
* ServiceNow connector is automatically installed for all new cloud instances.
* The SMTP server is automatically configured during the cloud instance setup.

## Known Issues

* The macOS self-elevation feature is not supported for systems running macOS 10.11 (El Capitan). The Privilege Manager Finder Extension does not work when installed on macOS 10.11. Thycotic recommends upgrading macOS endpoints to a newer version of the macOS operating system to utilize the latest feature enhancements in the Privilege Manager 10.7 and newer macOS endpoint agent.
